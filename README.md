# Driver Event Classification

This project has the goal of designing models and methods to better detect driver events dynamically.

# Dependencies

Here we list the dependencies and how to install them.

## Non-Python Dependencies

These dependencies will require different installation methods depending on the system.
Thus, we will just list the names of the packages that are required.

``` 
    1. Cuda
    2. CudaNN
    3. Python 3.10 
```

## Python Dependencies

We have included a `requirements.txt` file in the root of this repository.
Simply execute, `pip3 install -r ./requirements.txt` in the root of the repository.
For users that have only Python3, you may not have to use `pip3`, `pip` should suffice.
